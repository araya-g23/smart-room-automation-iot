# Smart Room Automation IoT System

This project is an IoT based smart room automation system using:

- Raspberry Pi as the IoT device
- PubNub for messaging
- AWS EC2 for hosting the backend server
- Relay module for light control
- Sensors for environmental monitoring (DHT22, PIR, LDR, Buzzer)
- Database for logging sensor data and events

The system allows:

- Remote light ON/OFF control through a web dashboard
- Real time brightness, and motion monitoring
- Live communication between Pi and AWS using PubNub
- Secure architecture with HTTPS and access control
